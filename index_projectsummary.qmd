# Mapping Vineyard Suitability in the UK Using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning

## Project Summary 

Fill in the sections below to provide a brief summary of your project. Each section should have no more than 100 words. Do not edit any of the headings.

### Problem Statement 

Our project addresses the challenge of identifying optimal regions for grape vineyard cultivation in the UK by integrating multiple environmental and climatic factors. Traditional approaches often rely on expert intuition or static maps, lacking dynamic data-driven analysis. With climate change increasingly affecting viticulture conditions, it is essential to develop an interactive tool that combines historical data, remote sensing, and machine learning. Our application allows users to dynamically assess vineyard suitability at various spatial scales and across time, providing a more adaptive and evidence-based decision-making framework for land use planning and agricultural investment.

### End User 

The application is targeted at vineyard owners, agricultural planners, land developers, and researchers working on climate adaptation strategies. It empowers users to interactively explore vineyard suitability across counties or custom-drawn regions, making predictions based on environmental factors. By offering spatial and temporal insights, the tool helps users optimize land selection for grape cultivation, adapt to environmental changes, and reduce investment risks. The application's accessible interface and intuitive design ensure that users without technical GIS or machine learning expertise can still easily conduct meaningful analyses and inform real-world planting decisions.

### Data

Our analysis utilizes remote sensing and environmental datasets from Google Earth Engine. We integrate GST and GSP from TerraClimate, GDD and flavor activity temperatures from ERA5-Land, soil pH from OpenLandMap, slope and elevation from SRTM and ALOS, solar radiation from ERA5-Land Monthly, and NDVI, NDWI, NDMI from Landsat 8 imagery. These datasets undergo cloud masking, temporal aggregation, spatial resampling, and threshold filtering to ensure comparability. Administrative boundaries for UK counties are also incorporated. This multi-source framework enables scalable and accurate vineyard suitability predictions across varying geographic regions and time periods.

### Methodology

We preprocess environmental datasets by applying thresholds for suitable viticultural conditions, including temperature, precipitation, elevation, solar radiation, and vegetation cover. After stacking key features, stratified sampling generates positive (vineyard) and negative (unsuitable) training data for a Random Forest classifier. The model predicts continuous suitability scores, categorizing regions into unsuitable, suitable, and highly suitable (>70%) areas, with high accuracy validated by cross-validation. Predictions support county-level selections, user-drawn custom polygons, and regional comparisons between two areas.Time-series analyses from 2010 to 2023 allow users to explore spatial and temporal shifts in vineyard suitability under changing environmental conditions.
### Interface

The application features a modular, panel-based interface designed for clarity, interactivity, and user-friendliness. Module 1 allows users to select any UK county to view historical trends in vineyard suitability. Module 2 enables users to draw custom areas directly on the map and run machine learning-based suitability predictions for those regions. Module 3 supports side-by-side comparison between two user-defined regions to facilitate comparative spatial analysis. Results are displayed through interactive maps, dynamically updating area charts, and easy-to-read statistics. The entire interface is built using Earth Engineâ€™s UI tools to ensure smooth interaction even with large datasets.

## How it Works 

Use this section to explain how your application works using code blocks and text explanations (no more than 500 words excluding code):

```js
Map.setCenter(35.51898, 33.90153, 15);

Map.setOptions("satellite");

var aoi = ee.Geometry.Point(35.51898, 33.90153).buffer(3000);
```
