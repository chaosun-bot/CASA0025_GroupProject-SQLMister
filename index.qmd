# Mapping Vineyard Suitability in the UK Using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning

## 1. Project Summary

Fill in the sections below to provide a brief summary of your project. Each section should have no more than 100 words. Do not edit any of the headings.

### 1.2 Introduction

#### 1.2.1 Background

Recent studies have shown that between 1981 and 2018, growing season temperatures in key UK viticulture regions increased by approximately 1°C, with GST values now exceeding 14°C, facilitating the expansion of vineyards and the diversification of grape varieties [@nesbitt2022climate]. Climate change is projected to further alter temperature, precipitation, and seasonal patterns, impacting the spatial distribution, productivity, and sustainability of viticulture [@fraga2013future]. These environmental shifts highlight the urgent need for dynamic, data-driven tools that integrate climatic and topographic variables to support vineyard planning and agricultural decision-making under future climate scenarios.

#### 1.2.2 Literature review

### 1.3 Problem Statement

This project addresses the challenge of identifying optimal regions for grape vineyard cultivation in the United Kingdom by integrating multiple environmental and climatic factors. Traditional approaches often rely on expert intuition or static suitability maps, lacking dynamic, data-driven analysis. In the context of evolving climatic conditions, there is a critical need for an interactive tool that combines historical records, remote sensing data, and machine learning techniques. Our application enables users to dynamically assess vineyard suitability across spatial and temporal scales, providing a more adaptive, evidence-based framework for land use planning and agricultural investment decisions.

### 1.4 End User

The application is designed for vineyard developers. It enables users to explore vineyard suitability across the UK, making predictions based on environmental factors such as temperature, elevation, and slope. By offering spatial and temporal insights, the tool helps optimize land selection, support climate adaptation, and reduce investment risks. Its intuitive interface ensures accessibility even for users without technical GIS expertise. Additionally, by interviewing investors interested in establishing vineyards in the UK, we collected key insights into ideal growing conditions. Investors prioritize stable climates and seek regions suitable for cultivating high-quality grape varieties, further informing the application’s focus and design.

### 1.5 Data

Temperature: MODIS/006/MOD11A2 — MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity

GST : TerraClimate dataset — IDAHO_EPSCOR/TERRACLIMATE

GDD : TerraClimate dataset — IDAHO_EPSCOR/TERRACLIMATE

GSP : TerraClimate dataset — IDAHO_EPSCOR/TERRACLIMATE

Slope: USGS/SRTMGL1_003 — NASA SRTM Digital Elevation 30m

Elevation: JAXA/ALOS/AW3D30/V2_2 — ALOS

Existing Vineyard: Exported from OpenStreetMap (OSM)

Land Use: Land Cover Map 10m — UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology

-   **GST** ensures warm enough growing season temperatures.

-   **GDD** captures accumulated heat units necessary for ripening.

-   **GSP** screens for sufficient but not excessive rainfall.

-   **Slope** helps in drainage and solar exposure.

-   **Elevation** filters areas too high or low for optimal grape production.

### 1.6 Methodology

We preprocess environmental datasets by applying thresholds for suitable viticultural conditions, including temperature, precipitation, elevation, solar radiation, and vegetation cover. After stacking key features, stratified sampling generates positive (vineyard) and negative (unsuitable) training data for a Random Forest classifier. The model predicts continuous suitability scores, categorizing regions into unsuitable, suitable, and highly suitable (\>70%) areas, with high accuracy validated by cross-validation. Predictions support county-level selections, user-drawn custom polygons, and regional comparisons between two areas. Time-series analyses from 2010 to 2023 allow users to explore spatial and temporal shifts in vineyard suitability under changing environmental conditions.

### 1.7 Interface

The application features a modular, panel-based interface designed for clarity, interactivity, and user-friendliness. Module 1 allows users to select any UK county to view historical trends in vineyard suitability. Module 2 enables users to draw custom areas directly on the map and run machine learning-based suitability predictions for those regions. Module 3 supports side-by-side comparison between two user-defined regions to facilitate comparative spatial analysis. Results are displayed through interactive maps, dynamically updating area charts, and easy-to-read statistics. The entire interface is built using Earth Engine’s UI tools to ensure smooth interaction even with large datasets.

## 3. How it Works

### 3.1 Data Preprocessing

``` javascript
var countries = ee.FeatureCollection("USDOS/LSIB_SIMPLE/2017");
var UK_boundary = countries.filter(ee.Filter.eq("country_na", "United Kingdom"));
Map.centerObject(UK_boundary, 6);
```

This project focuses on the United Kingdom. Five environmental variables were selected based on literature thresholds:\
GST 14.1–15.5°C (Nesbitt et al., 2022),\
GDD 974–1223°C·days (Nesbitt et al., 2022),\
GSP 273–540mm (Nesbitt et al., 2022),\
Slope 5–10% (Fraga et al., 2018),\
Elevation 0–220m (Gladstones, 1992).\
Landsat 8 imagery was clipped to the UK boundary and masks were generated with moderate threshold adjustments.

``` javascript
var gstMask = gst.gte(14.0).and(gst.lte(16.0));
var gddMask = gdd.gte(950).and(gdd.lte(1250));
var gspMask = gsp.gte(250).and(gsp.lte(600));
var slopeMask = slope.gte(2).and(slope.lte(15));
var elevationMask = elevation.gte(5).and(elevation.lte(250));
```

Land cover was reclassified to retain grassland, shrubland, and cropland.\
All masks were combined using logical AND operations to select suitable areas.

### 3.2 Machine Learning Modeling

Environmental factors (GST, GDD, GSP, slope, elevation, aspect, latitude) are extracted for the selected region and year from TerraClimate and SRTM datasets. These variables capture key climatic and topographic conditions affecting vineyard growth.

```{r}
var factors = GrapeML.computeEnvironmentalFactors(region, year);
```

A binary suitability mask is generated by applying defined threshold filters to the extracted factors. This step pre-screens environmentally favorable zones before machine learning.

```{r}
var suitabilityMask = GrapeML.computeSuitabilityMask(factors);
```

Positive samples are randomly generated within vineyard areas, while negative samples are drawn from unsuitable regions identified by the inverted mask. Samples are labeled and split randomly into 70% training and 30% testing subsets to ensure robust model evaluation.

```{r}
var positivePoints = ee.FeatureCollection.randomPoints({region: vineyards.geometry(), points: 200});
var negativePoints = ee.FeatureCollection.randomPoints({region: region, points: 400});
```

A Random Forest classifier with 50 trees is trained on the training data.

```{r}
var classifier = ee.Classifier.smileRandomForest({numberOfTrees: 50}).train({...});
```

The trained classifier predicts a suitability probability surface across the study region. Pixels with scores above 0.7 are identified as highly suitable for vineyard development.

```{r}
var suitabilityScore = featureImage.classify(probabilityClassifier);
```

If sample generation is insufficient, the basic environmental mask serves as a fallback to maintain prediction stability.
